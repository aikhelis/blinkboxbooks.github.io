To our customers [blinkbox Books][1] is an ebook service based around a really simple idea. Reading. We just love to read, whatever it is, wherever we are, and we want to share our passion for books.

We help our customers discover new stories and writers, catch up on old favourites and get recommendations from authors, publishers and fellow readers, delivered straight to their tablet or smartphone.
